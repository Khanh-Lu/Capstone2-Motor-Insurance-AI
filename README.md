# Capstone2-Motor-Insurance-AI

> Project Analysis using (Python, JupyterNotebook)

**This project focuses on developing machine learning models to `predict motor insurance premiums` using policyholder, vehicle, claims, and policy data. By leveraging AI, the model captures complex, nonlinear patterns beyond traditional methods, enabling accurate premium forecasts and data-driven recommendations for pricing adjustments and risk mitigation.**

### Structure:

Part 1: Data Overview & Exploratory Visualizations

- Examine the distribution of key variables such as crash time, location, and contributing factors.

Part 2: Explore Data Distribution

- Examine how data (numerical / categorical) distributed

Part 3: Machine Learning Model

- Developing machine learning models to `predict motor insurance premiums`
